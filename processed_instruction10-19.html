Left: carpal **with** skin and PTFE tubing. Right: An assembled finger (these steps are same for all fingers **except** the thumb).

Image3

Follow the color coding to route the tendons through the carpal apertures. **They should not cross each other**

Pull the tendons from the other side and push the finger subassembly onto the carpal until they snap together.

**Note:** The holes the tendons come out from at the other side of the carpal may appear random due to internal routing.

Similar to **Step 10: Finger to Carpal Assembly**.

Exercise additional caution during tendon routing, as this process is less intuitive compared to the other digits.

<!-- Step 12 -->
Attach wrist drive gear to the carpal assembly.

Image 2

Move all tendons to one side of the carpal assembly and insert the first guide rod through the hole on the side.

Move all tendons to the opposite side and insert the second guide rod

Image 5

All tendons should run between the two rods.

<!-- Step 13 -->

Insert PTFE tubing into all the top tower bores. Leave about 3mm of tubing on the bottom side.
Cut flush on the top surface using a sharp blade. Caution: If the PTFE tubing becomes compressed or deformed during cutting, ream the bore with a thin cylindrical tool (e.g., an awl or precision screwdriver) to ensure unobstructed tendon passage.
From the bottom side leave about 3mm of PTFE tubing. You can temporarily attach the bottom tower and cut flush based the botom tower bores (See Step 25: Carpal and top tower to bottom tower to understand how it should be).

Attach the 2 M4x16 screws with flat washers on the side of the tower.

Attach using M4 square nuts and the matching 3D printed part on the inside of the tower. **Important:** The square nuts should be inside the machined groove of the top tower assembly so they cannot rotate.

Instead of the 3D printed cylinders you can also use PTFE Tube 3x3.76 mm around the threaded part of the screw inside the tower. It can be slightly tricky to insert but gently wiggle and push the tube to facilitate insertion.

Attach a 4x8x3 bearing (same as finger joints) in the hole in the top tower assembly as seen from the arrow in the image. The fit is snug and you will need to apply some force to insert it.

The wrist timing belt should be attached as seen in the image. It should be between the two screws we just attached.

Use the M2x6 screws that come shipped with the XC430 wrist servo. Also don't forget to plug in the cables already.

<!-- Step 16 -->
It is recommended to first route the timing belt over the motor gear teeth, and then insert the motor. Apply firm pressure, so that the bearing is all the way in the tower.

<!-- Step 17 -->
The bottom of the carpal has 2 rows of holes. Sort the top row (blue) and bottom row (purple) by color as seen in the image.

Cross them as shown in the image.

Image 3

Pass the tendons to the top tower as seen in the image. Each tendon should go through the corresponding hole in the top tower intuitively. No crossings should occur.

When all tendons are routed, pull the tendons taut and mount the carpal onto the top tower. Then wrap the timing belt (of the wrist servo) around the Carpal gear. **Important:** It may be easier to remove the timing belt from the wrist servo and attach it to the carpal gear first, then reattach it to the wrist servo.


<!-- Step 18 -->
Important: Attach the timing belt on the carpal gear first, then attach the wrist bearings to secure the Carpal to the top tower. Tendons are omitted from this image for clarity.). Use 1.7x8mm screws to attach bearing retainer plates.

<!-- Step 19 -->
The upper screw should be on the top of the machined groove. Push the bottom screw towards the upper in order to put tension on wrist timing belt. Important: Apply a sufficient tension and tighten the fastener securely to specification. You can help by applying pressure from the inside as well. If not enough tension is applied, subsequent tension adjustment will be substantially more difficult.
